### CR3 to DNG Convertor 

__Dependency__
* [Adobe DNG Convertor](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/adobe-dng-converter.html)

This takes `.CR3` photos within a specific directory (you'd need to modify it for your own source/dest)  
and then converts them to DNG but with embedding the `CR3` in the `DNG`.  For extraction if need be at a later date
